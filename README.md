Compiled and edited by Ronald Mangang.

Closely following the build-up of the official Python language documentation.

Python 3.9 used.

&mdash; currently working on &mdash;

On completion, the cheatsheet will have the following three main parts.

2. [Intermediate](https://github.com/ronaldmangang/python-cheatsheet/blob/main/intermediate.md) (closure, higher-order functions, decorators, @property, RegEx, concurrent programming, parallel programming, metaprogramming, sockets, dynamic programming, advanced data structures) 
3. [Extras](https://github.com/ronaldmangang/python-walkthrough/blob/main/extras.md)
